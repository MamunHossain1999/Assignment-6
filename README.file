***** Project Name: Peddy-Pet Adoption Platform.

*****Short description of the Project:

 Peddy is an online platform that helps people find pets to adopt. It connects potential pet adopters with animal shelters and individuals who need to find new homes for their pets. The platform provides detailed information about each pet, such as their breed, age, health history, and personality, making it easier for users to choose the right pet for them. Users can search for pets based on their location, size, and personal preferences. Animal shelters can also easily update the platform with new pets that are available for adoption. The main goal of Peddy is to simplify and improve the pet adoption process, making it easier and more accessible for everyone involved.
